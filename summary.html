Motivation has always been one of the most important factors for student achievement in learning, 
as students with high motivation engage more in learning activities and are more likely to complete a course

Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), the assessment of motivation is needed in order to interact with students according to
their level of motivation
Assessment of motivation --- Personlized interactions, enhancing motivation of learner

Experienced teachers usually infer student‘s motivation from observational cues 
	such as posture, gesture, conversational cues etc. which are difficult to be processed by computer systems 
Therefore, most of the researches in the field of e-learning are directed towards finding a way to assess motivation from cues 
	that can be easily processed by the e-learning systems 
	(e.g. learner‘s actions, time spent on a task, his/her statements about his/her level of motivation).

<!--Assessment of Learner’s Motivation In Web Based E-Learning

In an e-learning system, information can be delivered in two different methods. 
The first is the asynchronous method where students can acquire knowledge at any time and in any place; 
	they can learn following their own pace. 
	The most popular forms of asynchronous e-learning are instructional websites, email, and forum. 
The second is the synchronous method where the teacher and the student interact in real time, 
	which include real-time web chats and video conferences
	
a need for having effective web based e-learning systems that can assess learner‘s motivation in real time.

paper proposes that motivation can be assessed in WBEL in real time by taking into consideration motivational factors such as: 
confidence, effort, and engagement

Modelling Confidence:
	propose to use the time variable as indicators for student confidence combined with other indicators such as help requests 
	and the number of steps in the problem solving process. 
	Additionally dialog based interaction may be used in more complicated situation.
Modelling Effort :
	propose to use the time variable such as time spent on the task as indicators for student effort while other indicators 
	such as the number of attempts to complete a task and requests for help to perform the task may also be combined as indicators.
Modeling engagement:
	propose to use cues as indicators for en-gagement/disengagement to include browsing fast rather than reading, 
	skipping sections, and time to perform the task or answering the questions.

Impact of Adaptive Educational System Behaviour on Student Motivation : geography learning

<!--Enhancing Student Motivation and Learning Within Adaptive Tutors - ASSISTments	

Video Feedback : to enhance student motivation and performance by enriching content through optimized feedback delivery,
	controlled trial in ASSISTments, Results suggested significant effects of video feedback, showing enhanced
	learning outcomes on next question performance after receiving
	adaptive video tutoring, as well as increased efficiency.
Student Choice : exploring opportunities to make students shareholders in the learning process, 
	Those given choice were asked to select their feedback medium, while those without choice were
	randomly assigned to receive either text or video feedback.
	Results suggested that even if feedback was not ultimately used, students who were prompted to choose their feedback medium
	significantly outperformed those who were not.
Partial Credit, to promote vice usage of hints : attempting to boost motivation and proper system usage through improved assessment techniques.
	Adaptive tutoring systems typically function through measures of binary correctness on a student’s first attempt or first action within
	a problem. 
	Within such systems, students who take advantage of tutoring feedback are unduly penalized.  
	This creates an environment in which students are afraid to use the beneficial features of these platforms, or instead, overuse feedback if they
	have already lost credit (i.e., skipping to the answer rather than reading a series of hints). 
	The establishment of partial credit scoring would help to alleviate these issues, serving to motivate
	student performance while simultaneously offering teachers a more robust view of student knowledge.

<!--Motivating Learning in the Age of the Adaptive Tutor - ASSISTments

2 facets of my research: 
	compelling aspects of adaptive tutoring systems is their ability to provide students with feedback at critical moments to optimize learning gains.
	
	the optimization of feedback delivery and 
		problem:
			a) Disengagement With Feedback.
				both questions and feedback have traditionally been presented using rich text.
				In some cases, the feedback is too dense, too simplistic, or otherwise boring.
			b) Maladaptive Usage of Feedback
				In other cases, students are deterred from the appropriate use of feedback because 
				the system records binary correctness on their first attempt or action when solving a problem.
				This can create an environment in which students avoid feedback due to the potential for penalization
							           or instead, overuse feedback if they have already lost credit (i.e.,jumping to the answer rather than reading through a series of hints).
			Disengaging feedback and maladaptive practices surrounding the use of feedback reduce the likelihood
			of robust learning.
		sol:
			a) Enhancing Feedback through Video and Partial Credit.
			According to Mayer’s multimedia principles for the optimal design of e-Learning environments, 
			it is possible to use hypermedia elements (i.e., video) to promote active learning while reducing cognitive load
			systems that make use of video tend to do so in a manner that resembles lecturing (i.e., Khan Academy) 
			rather than content specific feedback. 
				a novel approach is taken to embed brief (15-30 second) video snippets as feedback within the ASSISTments platform.
			b) data mining has revealed that partial credit scoring would help 
			to alleviate the maladaptive usage of feedback, serving to motivate student performance 
			while simultaneously offering teachers a more robust view of student knowledge.
		result:
			a) a randomized controlled trial comparing video and text feedback within the realm of middle school mathematics 
			Results suggested a significant effect of video feedback, showing enhanced performance on questions following
			adaptive video tutoring, as well as increased efficiency in problem solving. 
			Further, the majority of students self-reported video as a positive addition to their assignment.
			--Additional research has since investigated the specific elements of feedback delivery (i.e., audio, graphical, textual) 
			using motivational feedback delivered via a pedagogical agent
			b) data mining approaches to develop and refine multiple models of partial credit scoring
		Next Steps:
			Next steps for the ASSISTments platform include the development of a contextual K-armed bandit
			algorithm that will learn how and when to provide optimal feedback for each student.

	the provision of student autonomy
		problem:
			ASSISTments is built largely around assessment, putting teachers in control of assignments and
			leaving students with little say (a traditional approach to education). 
			However, the
			platform offers untapped opportunities to examine the motivational effect of choice.

			Results suggested that even if feedback was not ultimately utilized, students who were prompted
			to choose their feedback medium significantly outperformed those who were not.

<!--Motivational Design in an Intelligent Tutoring System That Helps Students Make Good Task Selection Decisions - Lynette : Equation Solving

	current work uses a user-centered design approach to extend an ITS for equation
	solving, Lynnette, so the new designs may motivate and help students learn
	to apply a general, transferable rule for effective problem selection, namely,
	to select problem types that are not fully mastered (“Mastery Rule”).

User Research for user-centered design
	Classroom Experimentation : for user-centered design
		found that the presence of an Open Learner Model (OLM) significantly improves students’ problem selection decisions
			For the noOLM condition, on average, 34% of the problems completed by each student were from mastered levels, 
									   while only 8% of the problems were selected from the mastered levels for the OLM condition.
			Students in the OLM condition selected significantly fewer mastered problems as compared to the noOLM condition
			OLM might have encouraged the students to work in new levels in order to fill all the mastery bars. 
			
		Students tend not to challenge themselves with new levels, and often fail to persevere in more difficult levels
	Interviews and Storyboards : for user-centered design
		The students do not understand the concept of mastery, and have misconceptions about the mastery bars in the OLM
			introduced the Mastery Rule in some of our storyboards, we
			also found that it was not difficult for students to understand and accept the rule. The
			Mastery Rule can be explicitly taught to the students.
		
		The lack of motivation may prevent the students from applying the Mastery Rule even if they are aware of the strategy.
Prototypes of tutor features
	designed prototypes of tutor features that aim to foster a mastery-approach orientation as well as transfer of the learned Mastery Rule
	when the scaffolding is faded

<!--The Effects of Motivational Modeling on Affect in an Intelligent Tutoring System

	Studies the differences in learners’ affective state transitions in two learning environments on ecology for young learners namely, Ecolab and M-Ecolab. 
	In terms of cognitive content and pedagogy, the two environments were exactly the same. The principal difference was that the M-Ecolab incorporates motivational scaffolding whose behavior
	is driven by a model of the learner’s motivation, while Ecolab does not.

	Affective states and transitions among students were studied in two private, co-educational grade schools in the Philippines.
	Each student used Ecolab or M-Ecolab for 40 minutes, and each student’s affect was observed 12 times as he or she used the software. 
	The observations of affect were conducted using Baker, Rodrigo, & Xolocotzin’s method for quantitative field observations of
	student behavior and affect. The observations were carried out by a team of three observers, working in pairs during any given observation session.
	each observation lasted twenty seconds, and was conducted using peripheral vision
	Within an observation, each observer coded the student’s affective state. 
	The affective categories coded were boredom, confusion, delight, surprise, frustration, flow, and the neutral state
	observers looked for students’ gestures, verbalizations, and other types of expressions

	Considering both the overall prevalence of each affective state within
	Ecolab and M-Ecolab and the likelihood of transitions between states, study focused on 
	how a student’s current affective state influences the probability of a student being in the
	same specific affective state or a different state 180 seconds later.
	
	results suggest that both Ecolab and M-Ecolab are generally successful in
	encouraging Flow and avoiding Frustration but that students still experienced a
	considerable amount of Boredom
	
	It was observed that a student who is bored in Ecolab/M-Ecolab is likely to still be bored 180 seconds later, 
	and a student who is frustrated is likely to still be frustrated 180 seconds later
	In M-Ecolab, there was a statistically significant likelihood that a student seen in delight continues in delight in 180 seconds later 
	however this wasnt the case in Ecolab.
	Study revelead that it wasnt yet clear which factors explain the persistence of delight in M-Ecolab, whether it is the motivational strategies, the
	narrative, other incentive to open the treasure chest. It acknowleged that it would be valuable to analyze in future
	research, which aspect of M-Ecolab led to the persistence of delight.
