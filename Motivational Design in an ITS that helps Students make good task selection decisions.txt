current work uses a user-centered design approach to extend an ITS for equation
solving, Lynnette, so the new designs may motivate and help students learn
to apply a general, transferable rule for effective problem selection, namely,
to select problem types that are not fully mastered (“Mastery Rule”).

found that the presence of an Open Learner Model (OLM) significantly
improves students’ problem selection decisions

designed prototypes of tutor features that aim to foster
a mastery-approach orientation as well as transfer of the learned Mastery Rule
when the scaffolding is faded

work contributes to the research of supporting SRL(Self Regulated Learning) in ITSs through a motivational design perspective


Strategic problem selection can lead to better learning outcomes as compared to randomly selected problems

For example, one ITS shares control over problem selection between students and the
system, fostering student motivation through some student control while preventing
the students from making decisions that are detrimental to learning

Little work has investigated whether and
how an ITS can be designed to help students learn the transferable skill of making
problem selection decisions that can be applied when the scaffolding is not in effect.

Our goal is to help students become better at self-regulating problem selection in their
own learning, so that they can actively apply the Mastery Rule later when there is no
ITS support for problem selection.


Theories of SRL stipulate that effective self-regulation requires not only
knowledge of metacognitive strategies(like Mastery Rule), but also motivations (like Badges,rewards) that foster the active use
of the strategies

how we can use motivational
design in ITSs to help students want to use the metacognitive strategies.

emphasize motivational design (like OLM)(design to foster motivations) in Lynnette to
help students want to apply the Mastery Rule when they are given control over problem
selection, in addition to designs (feedback messages from avatars) that help them correctly apply the rule.

combined user-centered design techniques including experimentation,
interviews, and storyboards to study how students naturally select problems in
the tutor, what knowledge they have for the Mastery Rule as well as their motivations
for following the rule.
