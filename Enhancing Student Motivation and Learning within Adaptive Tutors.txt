1. RESEARCH FOCUS
1.1 Adaptive Tutoring: ASSISTments
there remains a severe lack of research regarding the effectiveness of online learning systems for K-12 education

Students
	Adaptive tutoring systems offer interactive learning environments that allow students to excel while providing teachers a unique
	approach to classroom organization and data-driven lesson plans.
Teachers
	The platform is also a powerful assessment tool,
	providing teachers with a variety of student and class reports that
	pinpoint where students are struggling and enhance classroom
	techniques using real time data.
Edu-RESEARCHs
	the platform is unique in
	that it allows educational researchers to design and implement
	content-based experiments without extensive understanding of
	computer programming, serving as a shared collaborative tool for
	the advancement of the science of learning

	
Essentially, my work seeks to 
enhance student motivation and performance by enriching content through optimized feedback delivery,
1.2.1 Feedback Mediums
	Until recently, virtually all feedback within the ASSISTments
	tutoring platform was provided using text, typically with font
	color or typeset signifying important variables
	
	the introduction of matched content video feedback to the
	ASSISTments platform through brief 15-30 second YouTube
	recordings offered a novel approach to investigating hypermedia
	within an adaptive setting
	
	controlled trial in ASSISTments, Results suggested significant effects of video feedback, showing enhanced
	learning outcomes on next question performance after receiving
	adaptive video tutoring, as well as increased efficiency.

1.2.2 Student Choice (Control-value theory in realm of education)
	Choice is an intrinsically motivating force that has the potential to boost subjective control,
	
	By providing the student with choices at the start of her assignment, it may be possible to enhance
	expectancies regarding her performance and thereby enhance achievement emotions such as motivation
	
	Feedback medium personalization offers one simple method to examine the
	motivational effect of choice within these platforms.
	
	Those given choice were asked to select their feedback medium, while those without choice were
	randomly assigned to receive either text or video feedback.
	Results suggested that even if feedback was not ultimately used, students who were prompted to choose their feedback medium
	significantly outperformed those who were not.

1.2.3 Improving Assessment(Partial Credit)
	Adaptive tutoring systems typically function through measures of binary correctness on a student’s first attempt or first action within
	a problem. 
	Within such systems, students who take advantage of tutoring feedback are unduly penalized.  

	This creates an environment in which students are afraid to use the beneficial features of these platforms, or instead, overuse feedback if they
	have already lost credit (i.e., skipping to the answer rather than reading a series of hints). 

	The establishment of partial credit scoring would help to alleviate these issues, serving to motivate
	student performance while simultaneously offering teachers a more robust view of student knowledge.
