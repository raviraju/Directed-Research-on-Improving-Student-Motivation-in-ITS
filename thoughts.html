Motivation ?
the more students solves/attempts to solve a problem for unmastered concepts, such
concepts shall not be asked in exam
eventually personalized exam intended to just record mastery level
	with use of standardized exam, still students are unsure what they are good at
	instead of 1 numeric score, we should have a histogram of concept mastery level

Frequency of usage of adaptive system( time spent on unmastered/difficult question, login time)

Can student motivation be driven if ITS requires that the more, the students solves/attempts to solve a problem which belongs to an individual's unmastered concepts, the less would be probability of such concepts being asked in exam. 
Hence student might tend to pick questions which are difficult from student's perspective to practice on homework rather than to face them on an exam.
So eventually we may have a personalized exam designed so as to assess and record mastery level for each student.

Inverted-U Hypothesis suggests that really easy and
really hard questions should have negative impact on students’ motivation
